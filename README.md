# Over view
This repository contains a Python-based spam-ham classifier that utilizes the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm. The model is trained on a dataset of emails labeled as spam or ham. 
# Libraries Used
1. Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
2. Scikit-learn: For machine learning algorithms and model evaluation.
3. NLTK: For natural language processing tasks like text preprocessing.
4. Streamlit: For building the user interface.

# Model
Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier is employed for spam-ham classification.

# Data Set
The data set was taken from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset).

# Getting Started
